goodSeed: (a) we have judged that they are all good
AnnoSeed: (b) the ones for which we have to judge the correctness of samples
		    xx_mengfei: I remove the instances I think incorrect, good instances remained
		    xx_original: all instances
		   (I don't manual check sollen-ep-supposed, they are too many, I'm confused and don't feel well to check them.)
LeoSeed: data for Leo to do annotation. (except sollen-ep-supposed, other data is based the data, which I already removed the bad ones, so they should be not bad)

There are two statistics files
statGood.txt: modals and senses
instances.txt: instances of every seed
